# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz
The assignment asked for a timed coding quiz with multiple choice questions. After the quiz, users should be able to enter their initials.

This is still a work in progress. While the timer and quiz questions load, there are still issues with buttons targeting correct answers and the prompt asking a user's initials shows up at the wrong time.

## Your Task

At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, you’ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment&mdash;perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use the skills covered in this module, this Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

This week’s coursework will equip you with all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.
